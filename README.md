An api server for frontend developers. This application builds a local mock server for your specified endpoints and response.


> Are you working with a team of engineers still in the process of setting up a backend for your frontend project. But you need a frontend server to test your designs and see if everything goes as predicted. Then this application is for you.
> Just make use of a simple to use GUI panel to setup a server that returns a response based on the rules you specify. And then you can go on with your project without worrying about when the backend guys get done with the actual server ðŸ˜‰.
